# ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á \<Namaste\> üôèüèΩ It's Good To See You! :blue_heart:

Call me **mova**. I'm a dedicated computer programmer who finds joy in coding regardless of programming language. Open to collaborating on projects and exploring innovative ideas. I believe that while anyone can code, crafting high-quality code sets one apart.<br/><br/>

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

class Programmer:

    def __init__(me):
        me.name:str = "Mova"
        me.other_name:str = "mova"
        me.current_role:str = "Data Engineer"
        me.language_spoken:list = ['en_IN', 'hi_IN', 'gn_IN']
        me.active_since:int = 2011
        me.active_on_github_since:int = 2023

    def say_thank_you(me):
        print('Thanks for dropping by', f'have a great rest of the day! ~ {me.other_name}', sep =', ', end='\n\n')

mova = Programmer()
mova.say_thank_you()
```
